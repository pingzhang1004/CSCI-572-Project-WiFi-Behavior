# Analysis of Network Behavior
###### * Using C++ programming language on NS-3 Platform
#### 1.Developed and analyzed two network topologies on the NS-3 Platform to address hidden and exposed terminal issues
#### 2.Monitored and recorded RTS/CTS/ACK signals and data transmission times, elucidating WiFiâ€™s MAC protocol solutions for these challenges
#### 3.Measured route acquisition latency variations under the AODV protocol at differing node speeds on NS-3, providing insights into network efficiency and reliability.
#### The animation is visualizing a scenario in which nodes communicate in an ad-hoc manner using the AODV routing protocol, and the RTS/CTS mechanism is in use to exposed terminal problems.

##### Nodes: There are 4 nodes in the network, labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.
##### Node 0 is on the far left.
##### Node 1 is a bit to the right of Node 0.
##### Node 2 is further to the right.
##### Node 3 is on the far right.
##### Figure Visualization the Record in exposed terminal 
##### In the Figure, it appears that Node 1 is communicating with Node 2 and Node 2 is communicating with Node 3 simultaneously.Radii around Nodes: The circles around each node likely represent the communication range or the transmission range of the nodes. If another node is within this circle, it can directly communicate with the node.
